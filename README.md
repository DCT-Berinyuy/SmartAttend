## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### RFID Module Not Detecting Cards

**Symptoms:** No response when card is placed on reader

**Solutions:**

- ✓ Check RFID module is connected to **3.3V** (NOT 5V!)
- ✓ Verify SPI pins: 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO), 13 (SCK)
- ✓ Check RST pin connected to Pin 9
- ✓ Try different RFID card
- ✓ Ensure card is MIFARE Classic 1K compatible
- ✓ Check for loose connections

### LEDs Not Working

**Symptoms:** LEDs don't light up or stay on

**Solutions:**

- ✓ Check LED polarity (long leg = +, short leg = -)
- ✓ Verify 220Ω resistors are connected
- ✓ Test LEDs with multimeter
- ✓ Check pin numbers: Red=6, Green=5, Blue=4
- ✓ Upload simple LED blink test sketch

### Buzzer Not Beeping

**Symptoms:** No sound from buzzer

**Solutions:**

- ✓ Check buzzer polarity (+ to Pin 8, - to GND)
- ✓ Verify it's an **active** buzzer (not passive)
- ✓ Test with simple digitalWrite HIGH/LOW
- ✓ Try different buzzer
- ✓ Check buzzer voltage rating (3-5V)

### Serial Communication Issues

**Symptoms:** No data in Serial Monitor or logger script

**Solutions:**

- ✓ Check USB cable connection
- ✓ Select correct COM port in Arduino IDE
- ✓ Set baud rate to **9600**
- ✓ Try different USB port
- ✓ Restart Arduino IDE
- ✓ Check serial port permissions (Linux): `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER`

### Card Programming Fails

**Symptoms:** "Authentication failed" or "Write failed" errors

**Solutions:**

- ✓ Use fresh, unprogrammed cards
- ✓ Some cards may be read-only
- ✓ Try different memory blocks
- ✓ Check RFID module connections
- ✓ Ensure card is MIFARE Classic 1K

### Python Script Can't Find Arduino

**Symptoms:** "Arduino not found" error

**Solutions:**

- ✓ Check Arduino is connected via USB
- ✓ Check USB cable is data-capable (not charge-only)
- ✓ Install pyserial: `pip install pyserial`
- ✓ Check port permissions (Linux): `ls -l /dev/ttyACM*`
- ✓ Try different USB port
- ✓ Manually specify port in script

### Bash Script Permission Denied

**Symptoms:** "Permission denied" when running script

**Solutions:**

```bash
chmod +x attendance_logger.sh
# If still fails, check serial port permissions:
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
# Log out and log back in
```

## 📋 Serial Output Format

Attendance records are output in CSV format:

```
ATTENDANCE,Date,Time,Name,Email,WhatsApp,MatricNo
```

**Example:**

```
ATTENDANCE,2026-02-08,09:15:23,John Doe,john@school.edu,+237123456789,MAT001
```

**Note:** `DATE` and `TIME` placeholders are replaced by logger scripts with actual timestamps.

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- **Card Cloning:** MIFARE Classic 1K cards can be cloned. For high-security applications, consider upgrading to MIFARE DESFire or other encrypted cards.
- **Physical Security:** Store programmed cards securely to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Data Privacy:** Attendance records contain personal information. Handle according to your institution's data protection policies.
